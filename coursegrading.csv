1,"There is no final exam.
Grading	The final grade is determined by performance on the quizzes (25 points/quiz, 125 points total), the labs and the design project (75 points total). In addition, you must have a non-zero score for each of the required labs and all the on-line lab questions must be checked off as a prerequisite for passing the course. A missing required lab will result in a failing grade; incompletes will not be given for unfinished laboratory work.

Once your combined score has been computed as explained above, here's how grades will be assigned:

Grade	Requirement
A	175 <= total points
B	155 <= total points < 175
C	135 <= total points < 155
D	115 <= total points < 135
F	total points < 115, missing required lab",75,0,125

Each student is given three free extensions that may be used to turn in a homework at the next class without penalty (for example, if a homework is due on Tuesday but you turn it in Tuesday evening, Wednesday or before class on Thursday, you will be charged one extension and your grade will not be impacted). Only one extension may be used per homework. Our expectation is that most students will not need to use these extension, but they are a buffer for extraordinary circumstances.

Once you're out of extentions, 50% will be deducted from your grade for each late class period. Homeworks may not be turned in after solutions have been handed out (usually one or two class periods after the due date).
